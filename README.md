## 🌒 Overview

**The Crown of Embers** is a narrative-driven text RPG where you awaken after ten years of stillness to find the world has fallen into ruin. The sun no longer rises, the kingdom lies in shadow, and a once-sacred artifact, the Crown of Embers, has vanished.

You were a Warden, a forgotten guardian of the Crown. Memory shattered, you must navigate a haunted land to find the crown, or forge a new one in its place.
